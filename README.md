# Pokemon_Data_Analysis_Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pokemon_Data_Analysis_Challenge repository! This repository is designed to help learners practice common Pandas operations with practical exercises. Each challenge focuses on specific data manipulation and analysis tasks, providing a hands-on learning experience.

The exercises use the `Pokemon.csv` dataset to explore real-world data scenarios. Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate data enthusiast, these challenges will sharpen your Pandas skills.

## Challenges Overview

### Challenge 1: Loading and Exploring the Data

- Load the `Pokemon.csv` dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Display the first 10 rows of the dataset.
- Print the column names and their data types.
- Find the total number of rows and columns in the dataset.

### Challenge 2: Filtering and Selection

- Select only the rows where the Pokémon type is Fire.
- Find all Pokémon with a speed greater than 100.
- Display the names and types of all Pokémon whose total stats are greater than 500.

### Challenge 3: Grouping and Aggregation

- Group the Pokémon by their primary type and find the average attack for each type.
- Find the maximum defense stat for each Pokémon type.

### Challenge 4: Sorting and Ranking

- Sort the Pokémon by their speed in descending order.
- Rank the Pokémon based on their total stats.

### Challenge 5: Handling Missing Data

- Identify if there are any missing values in the dataset.
- Replace any missing values with the column mean or median.

### Challenge 6: Adding New Columns

- Create a new column called `Power Ratio` as the ratio of attack to defense.
- Add a column called `Is_Legendary` that is True if the Pokémon is legendary, otherwise False.

### Challenge 7: Advanced Analysis

- Find the Pokémon with the highest combined attack and speed.
- For each type, find the Pokémon with the best defense.

### Challenge 8: Visualization (Optional)

- Plot a bar chart showing the average HP for each Pokémon type.
- Create a scatter plot of Attack vs. Defense for all Pokémon.

### Challenge 9: Exporting Data

- Save the filtered dataset (e.g., only Pokémon with total stats > 500) to a new CSV file.

## Dataset

The dataset used in these challenges is `Pokemon.csv`, which contains various attributes of Pokémon, such as:

- Name
- Type(s)
- Stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.)
- Total Stats
- Legendary Status
